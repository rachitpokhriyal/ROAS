If you are working with the Cloud Function, use the requirements_cloud.txt file for dependencies. Please note that running the Cloud Function can take around 6 minutes for each execution, so we highly recommend working locally for development and testing.
To install the required dependencies for the Cloud Function, use the following command: pip install -r requirements_cloud.txt

For local development on your machine, use the requirements_local.txt file for dependencies. This allows you to work more efficiently and test your code locally before deploying it to the cloud.
To install the required dependencies for local development, use the following command:pip install -r requirements_local.txt
